desc: "Conceived and directed by Francesca Foscarini and Cosimo Lopalco and enriched by the artistic contribution of ErGao and Noel Pong, Italy -Museum of Elsewhere is a contemporary dance, performance and installation art project that develops in several locations and works on the themes of the contemporary museum and the relationship between architectural space and the body.
The artists, through the exploration of the historical-cultural identity of the country, measure themselves with the creation of a singular “museum” where the living body, in its intrinsic irreproducibility, becomes a work of art. The collection of works exhibited and staged explore Italian cultural history (the cinema of the early Pasolini, Fellini, the extraordinary art of Antonio Ligabue, Venice with its light, popular culture, its dialects, a certain clerical sleepiness with its bells, the ritual of coffee, card games), and is complemented by the valuable insight and ‘other’ taste of the Asian artists ErGao and Noel Pong with their particular idea of the country.
