desc: "Community Tape vol.1 - Unity Makes Us Strong -, a compilation of 17 artists, 17 tracks, 100 limited physical copies. ITALIA90Â® is a clothing brand born in Turin in 2017. Founded by Michael Lorenzelli and Woc, supported by a group of friends and excellent minds from the Turin creative scene, the brand presents itself not only as a clothing design project but above all as a true experimental journey in 360-degree creative collaboration. Starting from the creation of accessories, unique garments, and customizations with carefully selected recycled fabrics, to the development of different collections. Thanks to the close collaboration between the various creative minds involved in the project, the brand soon becomes a reference point in the independent clothing industry."
