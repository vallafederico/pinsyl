desc: "A short concept film developed in collaboration with Bax Studio. A sequence of images and rhythmic information, a tool for engagement and storytelling that encapsulates the values of the project.

Rethinking our being in a bed! Finemateria is Milan-based design studio researching and playing with materials"
